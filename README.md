# Technical Support Curriculum
Brainstorming ideas for a technical support curriculum that would give anyone a solid enough foundation to work in a technical customer support position for many different companies. Suggestions are welcome and can be given by [creating an issue](https://github.com/that-pat/that-pat.github.io/issues/new).

Some of the below resources are books and some are blog articles (and still others are interactive programming tutorials). While I will try to mention which are which in the descriptions (still to come), they are ordered roughly by order of importance.
